# GShisen
Shisen-sho for GNUstep and macOS

## Notes:
Originally written for GNUstep on linux, that version has not been maintained in a couple of decades. The macOS version should be relatively stable, but it hadn't seen any attention in about the same amount of time. A lot has changed in macOS since then, so there's been a lot of new work smoothing that out.

The iOS version required a complete rework of the UI and flow. The original assumed the ability to do everything synchronously, so quite a bit needed to be brought up to date, even for macOS.
